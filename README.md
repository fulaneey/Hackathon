Hi I am Yarfulani Peter Pero. A newbie in web development however I am not new to the tech community. i have created a portfolio using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 
This has been a remarkable feat for me and I am glad PLP has been able to harness my skills and prove that anything is possible as long as you set your mind to it. 
I have set my mind on being a high achiever and that is what I will be.
I hosted my page using netlify.
Find a link to my portfolio below;
